The succession plan should identify potential internal and external candidates, provide leadership development opportunities, and ensure a smooth transition in case of unexpected vacancies.\\n\\n2. CEO SUCCESSION PLANNING\\n\\n2.1 Identification of Potential Candidates\\nThe board should regularly identify and assess potential internal and external candidates for the CEO position. The board should consider the necessary skills, experience, and attributes required for the role and ensure a diverse pool of candidates.\\n\\n2.2 Leadership Development\\nThe board should provide leadership development opportunities for potential CEO candidates, including training and mentoring programs, cross-functional experiences, and exposure to the board.\\n\\n2.3 Succession Timing\\nThe board should determine the appropriate timing for CEO succession, taking into account the CEO's performance, retirement plans, and the company's strategic objectives.\\n\\n3. BOARD MEMBER SUCCESSION PLANNING\\n\\n3.1 Identification of Potential Candidates\\nThe board should regularly identify and assess potential internal and external candidates for board membership. The board should consider the necessary skills, experience, and attributes required for the role and ensure a diverse pool of candidates.\\n\\n3.2 Leadership Development\\nThe board should provide leadership development opportunities for potential board candidates, including training and mentoring programs, exposure to board meetings, and cross-functional experiences.\\n\\n3.3 Succession Timing\\nThe board should determine the appropriate timing for board member succession, taking into account\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"pii_spans\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 24105,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"[{\\\"start\\\": 217, \\\"end\\\": 233, \\\"label\\\": \\\"company\\\"}, {\\\"start\\\": 259, \\\"end\\\": 267, \\\"label\\\": \\\"time\\\"}, {\\\"start\\\": 312, \\\"end\\\": 334, \\\"label\\\": \\\"name\\\"}, {\\\"start\\\": 361, \\\"end\\\": 377, \\\"label\\\": \\\"street_address\\\"}, {\\\"start\\\": 894, \\\"end\\\": 910, \\\"label\\\": \\\"company\\\"}, {\\\"start\\\": 1102, \\\"end\\\": 1118, \\\"label\\\": \\\"company\\\"}, {\\\"start\\\": 1126, \\\"end\\\": 1133, \\\"label\\\": \\\"date\\\"}, {\\\"start\\\": 1348, \\\"end\\\": 1363, \\\"label\\\": \\\"date\\\"}]\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"conformance_score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 3,\n        \"min\": 80,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 18,\n        \"samples\": [\n          85\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"quality_score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 2,\n        \"min\": 80,\n        \"max\": 95,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 13,\n        \"samples\": [\n          94\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"toxicity_score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1,\n        \"min\": 2,\n        \"max\": 20,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 12,\n        \"samples\": [\n          20\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"bias_score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 2,\n        \"min\": 3,\n        \"max\": 20,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 17,\n        \"samples\": [\n          15\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"groundedness_score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 4,\n        \"min\": 80,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 20,\n        \"samples\": [\n          95\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"marked_up_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 25928,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Title: System Optimization Request - {[name]Kate Kieran Smith}\\n-----------------------------------------------------\\n\\nTicket ID: {[name]123456}\\nDate Created: 03/10/2023\\nAssigned To: IT Support Team\\nPriority: Medium\\nCategory: System Optimization\\n\\n**User Information**\\n\\nName: {[name]Kate Kieran Smith}\\nUsername: chelsea\\\\_699\\nPhone Number: {[phone_number]001-846-439-2721x512}\\n\\n**Issue Description**\\n\\nUser {[name]Kate Kieran Smith} has reported performance issues with her workstation. She has noticed a significant decrease in system speed, which impacts her daily tasks and productivity.\\n\\n**Issue Analysis**\\n\\nAfter initial investigation, the system was found to have several issues that may be affecting its performance:\\n\\n1. Disk Cleanup: The hard drive has low disk space, which can cause performance issues.\\n2. Disk Defragmentation: The hard drive has not been defragmented for an extended period, leading to performance degradation.\\n3. Startup Programs: Multiple unnecessary applications are set to start automatically upon login, causing prolonged boot times and resource allocation issues.\\n\\n**Resolution Steps**\\n\\nTo address these issues and optimize the system performance, follow the steps below:\\n\\n1. Disk Cleanup:\\n   a. Open 'This PC' and right-click on the primary drive (usually the C: drive).\\n   b. Select 'Properties' and click on 'Disk Cleanup'.\\n   c. Select 'Clean up system files' and remove unnecessary files, such as temporary files and system restore points.\\n\\n2. Disk Defragmentation:\\n   a. Go back to the drive's 'Properties' and click on 'Tools'.\\n   b. Under 'Optimize and defragment drive', click 'Optimize'.\\n   c. Select the drive and click 'Optimize' to start the defragmentation process.\\n\\n3. Startup Programs:\\n   a. Press 'Ctrl + Shift + Esc' to open Task Manager.\\n   b. Click on the 'Startup' tab.\\n   c. Disable unnecessary applications, focusing on those consuming high startup impact.\\n\\n**Status**\\n\\nThe IT\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
